# Text-to-Speech Conversion in Google Colab

ðŸ“„ **Project Overview**  
This project allows you to convert any text you input into speech and save it as an MP3 file using Google Colab. Itâ€™s a simple and interactive way to turn text into audio using the **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)** library. Once converted, you can easily download the audio file to your computer.

ðŸŒŸ **Features**  
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Convert your text into natural-sounding speech using Googleâ€™s Text-to-Speech API.  
- **MP3 File Creation**: The converted speech is saved as an MP3 file.  
- **Download Option**: Download the MP3 file directly from Google Colab to your computer.

ðŸ›  **Libraries Used & Why**  
- **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)**: This is the core library used to convert text into speech. Itâ€™s fast, simple, and supports multiple languages.  
  - **Installation**:  
    ```bash
    !pip install gtts
    ```
  - https://gtts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 
- **pydub**: A versatile audio library that can be used for converting and manipulating audio files. In this project, itâ€™s optional, but useful for future enhancements like audio format changes.  
  - **Installation**:  
    ```bash
    !pip install pydub
    ```
- **Google Colabâ€™s `files` Module**: This is used to download the MP3 file from Colab to your local machine. Since Colab doesnâ€™t have direct audio playback, this method lets you save your speech file for personal use.  

ðŸ“œ **How the Code Works**  

1. **Import Libraries**: We import `gTTS` to handle text-to-speech, `pydub` (though not mandatory), and Colabâ€™s `files` module to download the file.
   ```python
   from gtts import gTTS
   from pydub import AudioSegment
   import os
   from google.colab import files

# Text-to-Speech Function: This function takes your text input, converts it into an MP3 file using gTTS, and then triggers the download so you can get the file.
def text_to_speech_and_save(text, filename="results.mp3"):
    """Converts text to speech and saves it as an MP3 file."""
    tts = gTTS(text=text, lang='en')
    tts.save(filename)
    print(f"Audio saved as '{filename}'")
    files.download(filename)

# User Input: The script asks for user input and processes the text, converting it into an MP3 file called results.mp3.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    user_input = input("Enter the text you want to convert to speech: ")
    text_to_speech_and_save(user_input, filename="results.mp3")

ðŸ“¥ Example Walkthrough

Input: "Hello, welcome to our text-to-speech demo!"
Output: An MP3 file named results.mp3 is created with the spoken version of the input text.
Download: A download link is provided to save the file to your computer.
